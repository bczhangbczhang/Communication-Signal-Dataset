# Communication-Signal-Dataset
Our Communication Signal Dataset for Automatic Modulation Classification
A new dataset for automatic modulation classification is presented. The dataset, including eleven types of single-carrier modulation signals with various noises as well as a fading channel, is collected with various signal-to-noise ratios based on a real geographical environment.
The dataset contains 22000 samples and each sample consists of time domain waveform and label. The label 0-10 corresponds to 2ASK, 2FSK, 2PSK, 4ASK, 4FSK, 4PSK, 8ASK, 8FSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and 64QAM, respectively. The range of signal-to-noise ratio is 0-20dB.
